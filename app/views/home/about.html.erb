				<b>Hello, my name is Robyn Adamson. I am a graphic designer and dabbler of illustration and craft.</b><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				I grew up in Southland where I recall activities of stalking small birds with my camera, watching and drawing anime and marveling at how far the sky stretches over the southern landscape.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:20px;">
				My quirky and elegant style developed while completing my Bachelor of Design Communication at Otago Polytechnic. I spent a further year working in Dunedin for both newSplash Studio and the FIEA through Ooid.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-top:20px;">
				<b>I am adapting well to Wellington and am available for commissions.</b>
			<p>
				If youâ€™re keen to work together drop me a line at robyn.a.adamson@gmail.com or we could chat at one of the Wellington Design Meet Ups.
			</p>
			<p>
				Look forward to hearing from you soon...
